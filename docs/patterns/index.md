# Project Patterns

Reusable patterns and approaches from the cyber.trackr.live project that can be applied to any OpenAPI-driven development.

## Universal Patterns

- **[Universal OpenAPI Patterns](./universal-openapi-patterns.md)** - Proven patterns that work for ANY OpenAPI project

## Pattern Categories

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Patterns**
- **Two-Tier Testing** - Separate spec validation from behavior testing
- **OpenAPI-First Development** - Specification as single source of truth
- **Multi-Language Client Generation** - Coordinated releases across languages

### üöÄ **Deployment Patterns**  
- **CORS-Free Documentation** - Interactive docs on static hosting
- **Version Synchronization** - Consistent versioning across all artifacts
- **Static Site Generation** - High-performance API alternatives

### üîß **Development Patterns**
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility** - Solutions that work everywhere
- **Automated Client Generation** - Minimize manual client maintenance
- **Comprehensive Testing Strategy** - Coverage across all validation layers

## Why These Patterns Matter

### **For Any OpenAPI Project**
These patterns solve universal challenges:
- Dependency management between specs and clients
- Cross-platform development issues
- Documentation deployment limitations
- Version consistency across artifacts
- Multi-language support requirements

### **Proven at Scale**
The cyber.trackr.live implementation validates these patterns with:
- 15+ OpenAPI endpoints
- Windows/macOS/Linux CI/CD
- Interactive documentation on GitHub Pages
- Generated Ruby client with helpers
- Two-tier testing architecture

### **Transfer Knowledge**
Learn once, apply everywhere:
- Same patterns work for simple APIs and complex enterprise systems
- Solutions adapt from prototype to production scale
- Approaches transfer between different API domains

## Getting Started

1. **Read the Universal Patterns guide** - Understand the core concepts
2. **Study this project's implementation** - See patterns in action
3. **Apply incrementally** - Start with one pattern, expand as needed
4. **Adapt to your context** - Modify patterns for your specific requirements

## Contributing Patterns

Found a useful pattern in your OpenAPI work? We'd love to document it! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/mitre/cyber-trackr-live/issues) or submit a pull request to share:
- New pattern discoveries
- Improvements to existing patterns
- Real-world implementation experiences
- Lessons learned from different domains

**Goal**: Build a comprehensive knowledge base of OpenAPI development patterns that benefits the entire community.
